<h3> WHY THE FUCK IS THIS GREEN. I DIDNT WRITE GREEN ANYWHERE </h3>

<p> A dildo is a sex toy that is <br>
usually penis-shaped and designed for <br>
vaginal or anal penetration. However, some <br>
do not look exactly like a penis. Dildos come <br>
in a rainbow of colors and a variety of shapes, <br>
textures, and styles. Some people prefer to use <br>
a dildo that completely resembles the color, shape, <br>
and texture of a real penis. But others prefer something <br>
different such as a dildo that is hot pink or one that <br>
lights up. Dildos can be made from a variety of materials <br>
including: plastic, rubber, latex, silicone, <br>
and “jelly”. Dildos can be used by people <br>
of all genders and sexual orientations. They <br>
can be used for masturbation or for other <br>
sexual activity. Dildos can be used alone or with a partner.</p>
